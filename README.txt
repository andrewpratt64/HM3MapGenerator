Notes for Blender:
	- Don't change the pivot point on any objects
	- The only properties currently used are Location, Rotation, and Scale
	- A Scale value of 1 in Blender is actually 2 meters. For an unscaled object in Hitman, set Scale in blender to 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.5
	- It's not recommended to have any objects other than cubes in the scene
	- All objects are moved up by 1.52 meters so that z=0 in blender aligns with the floor in the test.entity map
